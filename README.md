# Rock-vs-Mine-Classifier

# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a simple Machine Learning model to classify objects as either rocks or mines. The model is built using **Python**, with libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `sklearn`. The dataset used for this project is the Sonar dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training using `sklearn`
- Performance evaluation of the classifier

##Dependencies
-import numpy as np
-import pandas as pd
-import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
-import sklearn
-from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
-from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
-from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

## Dataset
- **Name**: Sonar Dataset  by Kaggle
- --source:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13n9BR_w9JYW03bYZBp2ydLPOwcSusKrf

- The dataset contains 208 samples with 61 features each. Each sample is labeled as either a rock or a mine.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, if any, and normalize the data.
3. **Model Building**: Train a simple classifier using `sklearn` (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or any other model).
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy or confusion matrix.
